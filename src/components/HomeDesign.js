//                  <p>To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Dumbledore, time passed with the swift surety of a Quidditch Snitch. 'You are protected, in short, by your ability to love,' said Dumbledore. 'The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's.'

//                     ‘Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Voldemort couldn’t touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.’

//                     Harry sat in silence. He was sure Dumbledore could see straight into his heart.

//                     ‘But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?’

//                     ‘Your mother died to save you. If there’s one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark… It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.’

//                     ‘I’ve always valued bravery,’ Dumbledore said quietly. ‘Yes, but sometimes bravery means standing up not just to your enemies but to your friends. And you, Harry, have shown that courage time and time again.</p>

//                  <p>“Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern... I’ll be damned if I allow my daughter to go through it.”
                    
//                     “Just because someone hurts you doesn’t mean you can simply stop loving them. It’s not a person’s actions that hurt the most. It’s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”
                   
//                     “Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.”

//                     “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
                    
//                     “It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”<br/>
//                     "I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others."

//                       "You’re only human. And as humans, we can’t expect to shoulder all of our pain. Sometimes we have to share it with the people we love. And sometimes that pain is too big to hold on our own."

//                       "There is no such thing as a bad moment with you. Every moment with you is worth living through. Even the worst ones."

//                       "I love you. And I’m not going to stop loving you. But I can’t be with you. Not the way things are now."

//                       "Naked truths aren’t always pretty. They’re just necessary."

//                       "You can’t control how your heart feels. But you can control how you handle it."

//                       "Sometimes the hardest decisions a person can make will most likely lead to the best outcomes. It just takes a while to get there."</p>

//                  <p>Terry didn’t remember walking into the lab, but she knew she was there. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, humming like a warning she couldn’t quite understand. Every inch of the room smelled of chemicals and cold steel. She glanced at the other test subjects, all silent, all still. Maybe they were just like her—searching for truth, unaware they were walking straight into a lie.
//                   Dr. Brenner entered without a word, his white coat moving like a shadow behind glass. The machine hummed louder as wires were clipped to her skin. “Relax,” he said, but his tone felt practiced. Terry closed her eyes, trying to block out the sharp sting of the injection. Colors swirled behind her eyelids. Then she felt it—a tug, deep in her mind. A presence. Someone else. Watching.
//                   It wasn’t just a hallucination. There was a girl, young and frightened, reaching out from the dark edges of her consciousness. Thoughts not her own whispered through her brain like radio static. The lab wasn’t just testing drugs—it was unlocking something unnatural. Terry’s hands trembled. Whatever was happening here, it was bigger than her. And it was only just beginning.

//                     <br/>
//                     “You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say.”

//                     “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.”
